Hey y'all this repository has been made so that we can share anything code related and get help with anything code related so at the moment there is:
1. A python cheat sheet that will be continually updated(msg me if you need anything added)
2. A project/todo list that you guys can add to freely
3. A data types notes

and if any of you guys need help feel free to message me: on github, on discord(@willtolomys), on email(william.coote5@education.nsw.gov.au) or anything else
