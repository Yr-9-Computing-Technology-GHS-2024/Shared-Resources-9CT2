#Classes are object constructrs or blueprints.

#Creating a basic class
class myclass:
    x = 5

#Creating an object in a class
p1 = myclass()
print(p1.x)

#When creating more complex classes you need to use specialized function commands such as __init__
class Person:
    def __init__(self, height, name, age):
        self.height = height
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

#Creating full blueprinted classes need to define the perameters in the __init__ command
person1 = Person(170,"jim",20)
print(person1.age)
print(person1.height)
print(person1.age)

#class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
class object():
    pass

#Classes can also inherit from other classes
